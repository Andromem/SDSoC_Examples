SDSoC Example Repository 
===========================

Welcome to the SDSoC example repository. This repository contains the latest examples to get you started with application optimization targeting Xilinx Embedded FPGA acceleration boards. All examples are ready to be compiled and executed on boards. These examples are written in both C/C++ and OpenCL flows. The "cpp" directory of this repository contains SDSoC examples in C/C++ form and "ocl" directory of this repository contains SDSoC examples in OpenCl form.

Further this repository is organized as follows internally within C/C++ and OpenCL flows.

### 1. GETTING STARTED

Collection of examples geared at teaching the user best practices in how to use different features of SDSoC and start on their own application. 

### 2. LIBS

Collection of common libraries used across all examples to assist in the quick development of application non-hardware targetted code. 

### 3. UTILITY

Collection of utility functions used as part of the Makefiles in all of the examples. This set includes Makefile rules and scripts to launch SDSoC compiled applications onto SDSoC emulation flow. It also contains makefile and readme generation scripts.
